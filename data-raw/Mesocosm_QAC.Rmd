title: "Mesocosome Microbiome QAC project"
---

I have an Excel file with data compiled from a Mesocosome about microbiome and QAC project.

To make this easy to share this dataset I will read it , covert it to an 'Data' file, and then document it.

Load the packages needed to preprocess the data:
```{r}
library(tidyverse) #to load data
library(readxl)
library(countrycode)
library(here)
```

Read the Excel file as a dataframe:
```{r}
KK_QAC_May2024_samples <- read_excel(here("data-raw", "KK-QAC-May2024-samples.xlsx"))

view(KK_QAC_May2024_samples)
```

Save to data folder:
```{r}
usethis::use_data(KK_QAC_May2024_samples, overwrite = TRUE)
```
