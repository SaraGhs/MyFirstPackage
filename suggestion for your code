To my understanding, for your sample data, I think it could be useful to add a code that helps you easily process the data. Alternatively, some kind of code could assist you in normalizing your data. 
If you have multiple steps to process the data, for example, I am attaching my code as an example:

# Define the columns to apply the transformation to
face_scanning <- c("open_percent", "close_percent", "averted_percent", "directed_percent", 
                   "congruent_percent", "incongruent_percent", "direct_percent", 
                   "foil_percent", "eyes_percent", "mouth_percent")

# Remove outliers and log transform for all columns in face_scanning
for (col_name in face_scanning) {
  
  # Calculate mean and standard deviation for the current column
  mean_value <- mean(data[[col_name]], na.rm = TRUE)
  sd_value <- sd(data[[col_name]], na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Define upper and lower thresholds for outliers
  upper_threshold <- mean_value + 2 * sd_value
  lower_threshold <- mean_value - 2 * sd_value
  
  # Remove outliers by filtering values within the threshold
  data[[paste0(col_name, "_sd_removed")]] <- ifelse(
    data[[col_name]] >= lower_threshold & data[[col_name]] <= upper_threshold,
    data[[col_name]],
    NA  # Assign NA to values outside the thresholds (outliers)
  )
  
  # Apply log transformation to the column with the "_sd_removed" suffix
  data[[paste0(col_name, "_sd_removed_log")]] <- log(data[[paste0(col_name, "_sd_removed")]] + 1)  # Log transform with +1 to avoid log(0)
  
}
This code starts by defining the columns I want to use (face_scanning). I find this approach ideal when working with multiple columns to process. The following code runs a for loop to calculate the mean 
and standard deviation, then defines the upper and lower thresholds. In our case, I used 2 standard deviations to remove outliers. Afterward, the code assigns the processed data to a new column, 
while keeping the original data intact. Finally, it normalizes the data using a log transformation, where adding +1 helps avoid log(0). I thpught adding a function follows this model could be 
helpful to work with your data, automates the process and time-efficient so you dont have to redo long line of coding for your every project.
